# Defeasible Reasoning

Tasks that require to explain about the possible consequences when additional context are provided

## Example

A sample query in a zero-shot setting:

```
Input:
In a future where Earth's composition has changed dramatically, a team of explorers is embarking on a mission to understand the new elemental makeup of the planet. Using a pie chart that shows a snapshot of the current elemental distribution, the team needs to construct a narrative that explains the shifts in elemental abundance and the potential impacts on the planet's geology and biosphere.

Output:
The narrative begins as the explorers analyze the pie chart, which reveals that oxygen, while still the most abundant element, has decreased to 47% of the Earth's crust composition. The team hypothesizes that a series of massive volcanic eruptions has introduced large quantities of silicon and aluminum into the upper crust, altering the balance. Silicon, now at 28%, has created extensive new quartz-rich geological formations, fundamentally changing the landscape.

These changes have far-reaching implications. The increase in aluminum to 8% suggests that clay minerals have become more widespread, affecting soil fertility and water retention. This could lead to shifts in plant communities, as species that thrive in silicon-rich soils become more dominant. Iron, at 5%, continues to be a crucial element for the formation of minerals vital for maintaining the magnetic field, which protects the biosphere from harmful solar radiation.

The team also notes the presence of other elements like sodium and potassium, which are essential for life processes, and their slight increase could influence the osmoregulation in many organisms. The narrative considers how the increased presence of these elements might affect marine and terrestrial life, potentially leading to new evolutionary paths.

The explorers conclude that while the Earth's crust has undergone significant changes, it continues to be a dynamic system. The shifts in elemental makeup are part of the planet's ongoing geological evolution, reflecting the ever-changing nature of its life-supporting mantle. They predict that studying these changes will not only provide insights into Earth's past but also its future, guiding humanity's efforts to adapt and thrive in this altered world.
